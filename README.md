# Breast_cancer_detection
Breast cancer is a world problem that affects both men and women but mostly in women. Early detection prompts early treatment and increases patient survival rate. Cancer cell are of two types; malignant  whcich are cancerous cell, Benign non-cancerous cell. The predictive machine learning model was deployed as a web-based application performs real-time breast cancer detection. Support vector machine with training accuracy of 93%, wall-time of 13ms, overall accuracy of 95% and standard deviation of 0.022, the machine leraning model was trained on 9 features of the wisconsin breast cancer dataset;
